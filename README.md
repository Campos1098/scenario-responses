## Replicating Results
In order to replicate the the classification accuracy results of my simple classifier and ANN (shown in Table 7), please do the following. 

1. In a terminal open at the current directory run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Run simple.py (which presents the simple classifier results)
3. Run ann.py (which presents the ANN results)
