# Classifiying and Optimising Tennis Scenario Responses
A repository for the Engineering Honours Thesis of Edward Campos, "Classifying and Optimising Tennis Scenario Responses".

## Replicating Results
Please do the following to replicate the classification accuracy results of my simple classifier and ANN (shown in Table 7). 

1. Run simple.py (which presents the simple classifier results).
2. Run ann.py (which presents the ANN results).

## Used Packages
The following packages were used with Python 3.9.6:
* numpy==1.21.0
* pandas==1.2.5

I also installed (and use) PyTorch version 1.9.0 from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
